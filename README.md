EDA was tougher than I anticipated, there were 80 features and one target initially.
Learnt to reduce dimensions by combining some features and to remove extremely skewed features.
Learnt to use collinearity to quickly identify Features worth looking into.
Need imporvement in feature engineering.
First time using lgb.
Worth revisiting to try out Weighted Model Ensemble and OPTUNA see if improvement happens.
RandomCV achieved MAE of ~16,500 and an r2 score of ~0.90.
Final submission achieved MAE of 15,586.
